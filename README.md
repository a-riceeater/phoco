This is a WIP alternative to google photos.

At this moment, I feel I have abandoned the project due to lack of time, but also due to Apple / Cordova limitations. I currently lack a solution to allow me to access full device library and photos without user interaction (basically no auto backups) causing issues and basically a lack of function.

If I ever feel like going back to this project, I will research ways to improve this.
If you see this right now, check out my other repositories! Also, I am currently working on a self-hosted music player (like jellyfin but for music), and if you are interested, contact me through [my website](https://elijahb.xyz).
